Fusim - ChangeLog
================================================================================

-2014-01-15 (v0.2.2)

    - Fix bug when parsing refFlat

-2013-06-18 (v0.2.1)

    - Fix bug when generating fusion breaks on exon bounaries. Breaks were 
      being double counted causing array index out of bound exception.

-2012-11-27 (v0.2.0)

    - Optimized GTF-to-Reflat conversion to use less memory
    - Fix Java 1.5 and 1.6 compatibility bug

-2012-08-13 (v0.1.0)

    - Added script to simulate sequencing reads using ART
    - Modified fusions to select random breakpoints
    - Modified background generator empirical method to add sturges method
    - Cleaned up runtime status messages

-2012-07-16 (v0.0.5)

    - Added intra-chromosome fusion generator. Simulates fusions within a
      single chromosome.
    - Modified text/FASTA output to include fusion type and fusion options
    - Added option to limit fusion generation to use only specific geneID,
      transcriptID, and chrom
    - Added foreign insertion option which inserts a randomly generated
      sequence between fusion breakpoints
    - Added option to generate self-fusions. These are fusion transcripts with
      only one gene that fuses with itself
    - Added option to generate tri-fusion genes. These are fusions from 3
      genes
    - Removed java 7 requirement. Now only requires java 1.5 and above
    - Removed main code relating to ART and bowtie alignments. This can be
      done easily via shells scripts

- 2012-07-05 (v0.0.4)

    - Removed options for ART and bowtie.
    - Fixed text output for generated fusion genes to be more like refFlat
      gene prediction format.
    - Refactored gene selection method. Added new option for selecting the
      method to use for selecting genes to include in fusions. Valid methods
      are uniform, empirical, or binned. The uniform method selects 2
      genes at random to include in a fusion. The empirical method randomly
      selects 2 genes based on the empirical distribution of the given
      background dataset using RPKM. The binned method computes the RPKM value
      and sorts genes into n bins. Two genes from each bin are then selected
      for fusions. 
    - Added option to force fusions breaks on exon boundries.
    - Added option to allow generation of fusion genes outside of reading
      frames
    - Added option to auto-correct orientation of genes selected for a fusion
      if located on different strands.

- 2012-07-01 (v0.0.3)

    - Added support for executing external program (ART) to simulate Illumina
      reads from generated fusion genes.
    - Added option to align simulated reads from ART using Bowtie. 
    - Added option to merge resulting alignments with background dataset.

- 2012-06-30 (v0.0.2)

    - Added conversion option to convert from GFF/GTF to refFlat genePred
      format. Should behave similiar to gtfToGenePred utility from Ken source
      utilities
    - Only use canonical chromosomes. Skip the haplotypes and unassembled
      chromosomes (ignore chroms which contain "_")
    - Added option to control number of threads to spawn when processing
      background BAM file
    - Added option to configure RPKM cutoff value

- 2012-06-29 (v0.0.1)

    - Re-factored GeneModelParser to use refFlat instead of refGene. Added a
      utility to convert GTF files to refFlat format.
    - Added GTF parser. Updated code to use Strand enum.
    - Implemented generation of read through fusion genes. Added option for
      specifying the number of read through fusion events to generate.
    - Added output to both FASTA and TXT formats.
    - Added option to include only CDS exons or all exons when generating
      fusion genes
